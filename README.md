Bing Search Automation Script
This is a Python script that automates Bing searches using the Selenium library. It simulates human-like behavior by performing randomized searches with delays, which can be useful for maximizing Bing reward points or automating search-based tasks.

🚀 How It Works
✅ Generates random search terms using the Faker library.
✅ Opens Bing in the Edge browser and performs a search.
✅ Waits for a random delay between searches to mimic human behavior.
✅ Repeats the process 30 times (configurable).

📂 Setup
Install the required libraries:
pip install selenium faker
Download the Edge WebDriver from Microsoft and place it in the specified location.
Update the driver_path variable with the correct path to your Edge WebDriver.

🔥 Usage
Run the script using:
python script.py

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.8+
Microsoft Edge browser
Edge WebDriver

✅ Features
✔️ Automates up to 30 searches (adjustable)
✔️ Simulates human-like behavior with random delays
✔️ Clean termination with try-except-finally handling

👨‍💻 How to Customize
To adjust the number of searches, change the value in:
for _ in range(30):
To modify the delay time, adjust the range in:
python
Copy
Edit
time.sleep(random.uniform(5, 10))
