## Bing Search Automation Script    This Python script automates Bing searches using **Selenium** and **Faker**. It generates random search terms, opens Bing, and performs searches with realistic delays to mimic human behavior. The script repeats the process multiple times and includes error handling for smooth execution and termination.
